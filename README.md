# Multilingual-Sign-Language-Translator

This project is two-fold endeavour with Comparative Study as the research part and Tri-lingual sign language translator as the application part. 

Objective:  

•	To study various machine learning and deep learning architectures, and to create the best performing model based on defined metrics.

•	To build a multiple sign language translator, which can take communications in one sign language and translate them into written text as well as other sign language hand gesture representations to enable trilingual communication. 

The proposed system uses three of the most recognised sign languages named American Sign Language (ASL), German Sign Language (GSL) and Indian Sign Language (ISL) image datasets.
